# Quick demo of inserting and retrieving unicode strings
# NOTE: your DBD::ODBC really needs to be built with unicode
# and this script will warn if not. You can comment the die out and it
# will work with some drivers without being built for unicode but you'll
# get slightly different output:
#
# with unicode:
# $VAR1 = [
#          [
#            "\x{20ac}" # note, is a unicode Perl string
#          ]
#        ];
# is utf8 1
#
# without unicode:
#
# $VAR1 = [
#          [
#            'â‚¬'   # note, not a unicode Perl string
#          ]
#        ];
# is utf8
#
