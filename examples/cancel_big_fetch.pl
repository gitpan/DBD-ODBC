# demonstrates that not fetching all of a result-set makes can make
# a difference. More recent MS SQL Server drivers are better at this so don't
# be surprised if this shows no difference between the 2 variations.
# However, in the past, cancelling a big select when you have not selected
# all rows has made a huge difference as MS SQL Server sees the cancel and
# stops sending the result-set.
