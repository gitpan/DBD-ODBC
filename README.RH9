There have been some reports that Red Hat 9 has build problems.  This is manifested by
build problems and the Makefile generated having lots of issues.

From what I can tell, as I don't have this problem on my RH9 system,
this is mostly due to people setting the LANG environment variable to something 
that is utf8 (again, as far as I can tell).  One example is LANG=en_US.utf8.  
By simply changing that to LANG=en_US, I have reports that the Makefile generated works.

Regards,

Jeff
