    Compiling the DBI sources for Adabas is fairly easy. First you
    have to set the usual environment variable "DBROOT", that
    points to the main Adabas installation directory, for example

	DBROOT=/opt/adabas-pe; export DBROOT	(sh or bash)

		or

	setenv DBROOT=/opt/adabas-pe		(csh or tcsh)

    Next point is to setup the environment variables that tell
    the DBI test scripts which DSN to use for the tests:

	DBI_DSN=dbi:ODBC:MYDB
	DBI_USER=demo
	DBI_PASS=demo

    (I've grabbed the appropriate settings for the widely spread
    personal edition.) Finally you have to create a file
    "/usr/spool/sql/config/odbc.ini" (the name is fixed, I did
    not choose it ...), which describes the connection parameters
    to use for DSN MYDB, for example

	[ODBC Data Sources]

	MYDB

	[MYDB]

	ServerDB=MYDB

	ServerNode=192.168.1.2		# Leave empty for local host

    I'd be happy to leave this away and use the dsn

	dbi:ODBC:servernode=192.168.1.2;serverdb=MYDB

    or something similar, but I didn't get this working. Perhaps
    someone at SAG can help?

    Finally do just the usual "perl Makefile.PL", "make", "make test"
    and "make install".
