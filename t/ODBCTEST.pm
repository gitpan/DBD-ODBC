#
# Package ODBCTEST
# 
# This package is a common set of routines for the DBD::ODBC tests.
# This is a set of routines to create, drop and test for existance of
# a table for a given DBI database handle (dbh).
#
# This set of routines currently depends greatly upon some ODBC meta-data.
# The meta data required is the driver's native type name for various ODBC/DBI
# SQL types.  For example, SQL_VARCHAR would produce VARCHAR2 under Oracle and TEXT
# under MS-Access.  This uses the function SQLGetTypeInfo.  This is obtained via
# the DBI C<func> method, which is implemented as a call to the driver.  In this case,
# of course, this is the DBD::ODBC.
#
# the SQL_TIMESTAMP may be dubious on many platforms, but SQL_DATE was not supported
# under Oracle, MS SQL Server or Access.  Those are pretty common ones.
