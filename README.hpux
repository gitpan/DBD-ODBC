Hopefully this will help someone compiling for HP/UX.  I pulled this off dbi-users from Jonathon Leffler.

If someone using HP/UX can refine this for me, I'd be grateful.

Regards,

Jeff

Hi,

If you look in Notes/environment.variables file in the DBD::Informix 
distribution, you will see a variable DBD_INFORMIX_HPUX_USELIBCL.  The 
documentation refers to libcl.1; you're running into the equivalent 
problem with libcl.2.  I suggest that you track down where that is 
used (Makefile.PL), and change the reference to  '-l:libcl.1' to 
'-l:libcl.\d' (should be good for a few years, anyway).  As far as I 
can tell, the libcl library provides nothing of value to ClientSDK.
